# Website

This is the repository for my personal website [koichin.com](https://koichin.com), used for blogging, showcasing my projects, and sharing all about myself. You can use this repository under [the MIT License](LICENSE).

## Todo

- [ ] Whether to redirect project pages to GitHub or keep them on my website
- [ ] Improve post gallery layout on mobile (It's fixed to be two columns now)
- [ ] Improve the home page layout
