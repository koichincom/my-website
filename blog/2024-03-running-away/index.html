                    I became a proactive truant and got depressed in my first year of high school because of the
                    intimidating
                    and closed environment and teachers. While at home, I was thinking about my purpose of attending
                    school,
                    studying, and living all the time. Eventually, I got a straightforward and obvious but essential
                    purpose
                    for living.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason why I am living is just to be happy. And if something bothers me to be happy, I can and
                    should
                    run away from it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We need to consider it well when we make big decisions. However, this simple policy does work. After
                    I got
                    this value, my depression almost recovered, and I felt free. I transferred to a famous online high
                    school
                    in Japan in my second year. It was a great decision. I could make great friends and meet great
                    teachers.
                    More than anything else, because I had more free time, I was inspired by a classmate to participate
                    in
                    extracurricular activities such as organizing events and joining presentation competitions, which
                    allowed
                    me to learn about a new world that I had never known before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, its high school is known as an advanced education system; there was an academic path support
                    division
                    of universities overseas, which kind of opportunity is rare in Japan. Because there was such
                    support, I
                    could join the online Oxford summer program and learn about the system of foreign universities to
                    grasp and
                    think about them deeply and rethink my life goals. As a result, I am in a U.S. community college and
                    aiming
                    to transfer to a 4-year university. I wish I had recognized myself sooner and escaped sooner before
                    I became
                    depressed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So far, it's been my story; I want to write what I can say from it from now on. We have a time we
                    have to
                    endure, but we also have a time we need to escape. Without context and background, we cannot decide
                    which
                    option to take. We need to consider whether there are enthusiastic dreams beyond the pain. We need
                    to think
                    critically and ask ourselves if we think so. Unsurprisingly, our lifetime is finite, and everyone
                    will die.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, when we think about how to make the most of our limited time and be happy, it is highly
                    contradictory
                    and self-destructive to put up with painful situations that do not align with our dreams and goals.
                    However,
                    quitting what you have kept doing is risky, and you might need to find out whether the pain leads
                    you to
                    your enthusiastic dream. In that case, it will be very effective to take your time for holidays or
                    vacations and do journaling or stuff like that to rest your mind. By taking distance from the pain
                    temporarily, you observe your situation objectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Running away from the pain is the opposite of running away from life. It entails happiness, dreams,
                    and
                    real life. The mindset we need to have is not a binary choice of whether to run away. It's moving
                    forward
                    toward your objects to be happy. Regardless of what others say, your life is yours, and my life is
                    mine.

                    I rewrote this post to learn more about how I wrote it and its English expressions. While doing it,
                    I felt
                    nostalgic, and my mindset improved. Even if you or I feel overwhelmed and disappointed by ourselves,
                    we can
                    feel our progress and improvements in the future. The past isn't back, but we are living in the now,
                    and we
                    can shape our future.
