This is my personal website where I share my blogs, showcase my projects, and provide information about myself. It's basically made by basic HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript with Jekyll as a static site generator, and it's hosted on GitHub Pages. The repository is public, and open-sourced under the MIT License. [GitHub](https://github.com/koichincom/my-website)
