This is a personal project where I document my journey as a developer and share my thoughts about technology, design, and human-computer interaction.

## Background

I'm passionate about creating meaningful experiences through technology. My interests span across web development, user interface design, and emerging technologies like brain-computer interfaces.

## Skills & Interests

- **Web Development**: Creating clean, minimal websites with focus on user experience
- **UI/UX Design**: Designing interfaces that are both beautiful and functional
- **Human-Computer Interaction**: Exploring new ways humans can interact with computers
- **Research**: Currently involved in DAHCI (De Anza Human-Computer Interaction) projects

## Goals

My goal is to bridge the gap between technology and human needs, creating solutions that are not just functional but also delightful to use.
