A collection of creative coding experiments and generative art projects that explore the intersection of mathematics, programming, and visual design.

## Overview

This project showcases my exploration into creative programming, where code becomes a medium for artistic expression. Through various algorithms and mathematical concepts, I create visual compositions that are both aesthetically pleasing and technically interesting.

## Key Concepts

- **Generative Art**: Using algorithms to create art that generates itself
- **Mathematical Beauty**: Exploring patterns found in nature through code
- **Interactive Design**: Creating responsive visual experiences
- **Processing & p5.js**: Utilizing creative coding frameworks

## Inspiration

The beauty of creative coding lies in the unexpected. When mathematics meets creativity, the results can be surprisingly beautiful and often reveal patterns we never anticipated.

## Future Directions

I plan to explore more complex algorithms, integrate machine learning elements, and possibly venture into 3D generative art and interactive installations.
