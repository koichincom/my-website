 We're too feeble. At the end of the day, we'll all die. You and I are two of the 8.2 billion creatures living on the planet, one of 200 billion trillion stars, and on the tiny point on the ruler of 13.8 million years. I won't be alive in the 22 century, and there will be no foot stamps. So, everything in the world is essentially nothing. This is what nihilism is.
