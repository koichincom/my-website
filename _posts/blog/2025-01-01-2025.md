I will write a short blog for the new year to clarify my head. 2025 is a year of victory or defeat. The main topic is 
the transfer application. I will apply to UC Berkeley and UC San Diego, and I want good news from both of them. To achieve it, 
I need to maintain my GPA, run two clubs I'll be in charge of the president, do some tutoring at school, and get 
explicit results from ML and Neurotech projects. On top of that, it's super important to eat, sleep, and exercise well 
to maintain my body. I will sense nostalgia for this year and the future as it will be the folk on the road. I'll think 
about the priority and do the things with a do-or-die attitude.
