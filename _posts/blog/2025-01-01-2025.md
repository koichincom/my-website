I will write a short blog for the new year to clarify my head. 2025 is a year of victory or defeat. The main topic is the transfer application. I will apply to UC Berkeley and UC San Diego and want good news from both. To achieve it, I need to maintain my GPA, run two clubs I'll be in charge of the president, do some tutoring at school, and get explicit results from ML and Neurotech projects. In addition, it's super important to eat, sleep, and exercise well to maintain my body. I will sense nostalgia for this year and the future, as they will be the folk on the road. I'll think about priorities and do things with a do-or-die attitude.
