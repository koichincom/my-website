<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This website serves as my personal portfolio and blog, built with a focus on simplicity and functionality. Using Jekyll, 
I streamlined content management by converting Markdown files into HTML and leveraged features like front matter to integrate 
JavaScript for dynamic elements such as date calculations. The project helped me deepen my understanding of web development 
fundamentals, including structuring and styling a website effectively.</p>

<h2 id="website-structure">Website Structure</h2>
<p>The site is designed with a clean navigation bar at the top, providing easy access to the following sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Homepage</strong>: A brief introduction to who I am and what I do.</li>
  <li><strong>Projects</strong>: Highlights of my work, with start and end dates calculated dynamically using JavaScript.</li>
  <li><strong>Blog</strong>: A collection of my thoughts and experiences, presented with clear formatting for readability.</li>
  <li><strong>About</strong>: A short biography with links to my social profiles for networking.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="design-philosophy">Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>I prioritized a simple and intuitive design to enhance user experience. The navigation bar and layout are clean and 
minimalistic, allowing users to focus on the content. Responsive design ensures the site is accessible across all devices.</p>
