  <li>
    <p>You were born to be free. Take others’ advice with a pinch of salt. Every action should eventually connected to your happiness, and its process can pleasure others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s no meaning in everyone’s life. Everything you care about is meaningless. So, do what you feel is meaningful and enthusiastic, and do it with great people. (≈ positive nihilism)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never mind the past, never stick to the future, but live in the moment. Thinking about the past never creates your future. Don’t waste your time. (≈ mindfulness)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Own only what you need, and love what you have. It’s the same thing in thinking. Get focused on what you need, and be enthusiastic about what you do. (≈ minimalism)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Separate your problem. Each task must be accessible. “Divide each difficulty into as many parts as is feasible and necessary to resolve it.” — René Descartes (≈ divide and conquer)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t make your current status your identity. Time is constantly moving, and your effort should change your status. If you stick to your status, you’ll never progress, and you’ll regret it. You only need direction, not satisfaction with where you’re now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never pursue perfection. Perfection brings nothing but wasted time. Make things work. Get things done.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
