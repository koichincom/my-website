This [Website](https://koichin.com) is designed to be **as simple as possible** while providing an effective platform to showcase my blogs, projects, and personal interests. It's for anyone who wants to know about me and explore my work. I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jekyll, and GitHub Pages. It consists of home, blog, project, vision, and about pages, and it supports mobile and tablet as its fully responsive design. [project page](https://koichin.com/project/my-website)
