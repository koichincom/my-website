    <h1>Vision</h1>
    <p>
        I aim to contribute to the development of Brain-Machine Interfaces and Machine Learning technologies.
        I believe that these technologies will revolutionize the way we interact with the world and enhance our cognitive abilities.
        I'm excited to be part of this journey and to make a positive impact on society.
