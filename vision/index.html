    <h1>Vision</h1>

<p>
    My ultimate life goal is to advance humanity through technology guided by philosophy. 
    While it's inevitable that we, including myself, will someday die, 
    I firmly believe that creating something valuable for humanity and our descendants is a lasting and meaningful legacy.
    Contributing to humanity's progress is, to me, the most essential and worthwhile direction one can take.

    Technology is like magicâ€”it's been having the power to transform the world. 
    I believe the next major leap forward will be in Brain-Machine Interfaces. 
    When we achieve the ability to seamlessly connect our minds with cutting-edge computers,
    it will accelerate progress across all fields and bring humanity closer to its highest potential.

    I'm not driven by money; I'm driven by technology, meaningful connections, and this vision.
    I aspire to embody the "<a href="https://paulgraham.com/fn.html">fierce nerd</a>,"
    dedicating myself to locking away distractions and working relentlessly on something that truly matters.
