    <h1>Vision</h1>

<p>
    My ultimate life goal is to <b>advance humanity through technology, guided by philosophy.</b>
    While it's inevitable that we, including myself, will someday die, I firmly believe that creating something valuable for
    humanity and its descendants is the most enduring and meaningful legacy one can leave. To contribute to humanitys
    progress is the most essential and worthwhile direction a person can take.

    Technology is like magic—it holds the transformative power to shape the world profoundly. I am convinced that the next
    monumental leap forward will come from Brain-Computer Interfaces. When we unlock the ability to integrate our minds with
    advanced computers seamlessly, the ripple effects will accelerate progress across all fields, bringing humanity closer
    to realizing its highest potential. This frontier isn't just about convenience or efficiency—
    it's about unleashing creativity, intelligence, and collaboration on a scale we've never seen before.

    I am not driven by money; my motivation comes from technology, meaningful connections, and this vision. I aspire to
    embody the ethos of the "<a href="https://paulgraham.com/fn.html">fierce nerd</a>," focusing relentlessly on what truly
    matters,
    shutting out distractions, and dedicating my energy to building something of lasting significance. This isn't just about
    ambition—it's about purpose. I have chosen the path to create, innovate, and elevate humanity and will pursue it with
    unwavering determination.
