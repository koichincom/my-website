    <h1>Vision</h1>
</div>

<p>
    My life goal is to <b>advance humanity by techonology with philosophy</b>.
    At the end of the day, we, including me, will die.
    But I believe the fact that we made something valuable for us, humanity, and our predecessors will be
    long-lasting as
    it's worthwhile. So, I believe contributing to humanity's advance is the essential and meaningful direction I
    should
    have.

    Technology is magic. It has changed the world. I think the next big thing will be Brain-Machine Interfaces. When
    we can
    directly connect to a cutting-edge computer at any time, that will accelerate everything and help bring humanity
    to the
    final stage.

    I will be the <a href="https://paulgraham.com/fn.html">"fierce nerd"</a> to lock myself in a room and work on
    something that matters.
